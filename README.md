<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>
In recent years, intelligent soft computing techniques such as fuzzy inference systems (FIS), artificial neural networks (ANN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) have proven efficient and suitable for a variety of systems. This paper presents an ANFIS-based navigation technique for mobile robots using sensor-based information to determine optimal movement directions. Real-time experiments and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in navigating through environments with stationary obstacles.

<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
As robotics engineers with extensive experience in autonomous path planning and intelligent control systems, we have observed the growing importance of advanced navigation techniques for mobile robots. Autonomous path planning has become a critical area of research, enabling robots to navigate complex and dynamic environments without human intervention. In such realistic settings, a mobile robot cannot solely rely on prior knowledge of its surroundings. Instead, it must utilize sensors to perceive environmental information and adapt its motion planning accordingly.
The development of intelligent soft computing techniques, such as fuzzy inference systems (FIS), artificial neural networks (ANN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), has significantly enhanced the capabilities of autonomous systems. ANFIS, in particular, stands out by combining the adaptability of neural networks with the knowledge representation of fuzzy logic. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methodologies, offering robust solutions for navigation challenges in unpredictable environments.
Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of ANFIS in various applications, including obstacle avoidance, target tracking, and dynamic path planning. By integrating sensor-based information such as obstacle distances and heading angles, ANFIS can determine optimal steering commands, ensuring safe and efficient navigation. This paper aims to further explore the potential of ANFIS by applying it to the path planning of an autonomous mobile robot. Through real-time experiments and simulations, we aim to validate the proposed method's efficacy in navigating environments populated with stationary obstacles.			
In the present study, a reactive behaviour-based mobile robot control system is modelled and implemented. The mobile robot aims to navigate safely and reach the target points without hitting obstacles present on its path.
